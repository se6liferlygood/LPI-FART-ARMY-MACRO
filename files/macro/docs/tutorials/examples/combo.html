            <p>
                at 1 I have "Chopper Broom", at 3 and 0 I have "Telamonser: the Chaos Edge" <br><br>

                ChopperBroom can be used to stop your momentum <br>
                what I want is to use any of the 2 telamonsters abilites and quickly equip ChopperBroom <br><br>

                I can do this using 2 scripts <br>
                one for the first and one for the second
            </p>
            <div class="code">K3QE1</div>
            <div class="code"> K0QE1</div>
            <p>
                K is <a href="../input/key/key.html">key input</a><br>
                these 2 scripts would equip Telamonster, press Q and E, then equip ChopperBroom <br><br>

                but there is a problem with this <br>
                if I equip and unequip ChopperBroom too fast I get stuck <br>
                to fix this I can block keys that I am likely to accidentally press <br>
                the script can also wait for a bit so I dont accidentally press it 2 times too fast
            </p>
            <div class="code">K3QE H4321 W100</div>
            <div class="code">K0QE H4321 W100</div>
            <p>
                H is <a href="../input/holdRelease/holdRelease.html">hold</a>, W is <a href="../wait/wait.html">wait</a><br>
                if the macro holds down these keys then it makes sure I cant press them <br>
                it will use Telamonster abilites then hold the keys from 4 to 1, ending at 1 <br>
                it ending at 1 makes sure I equip ChopperBroom <br>
                W100 makes sure the script runs for 100ms and holds the keys 4 to 1 for 100ms <br>
                this makes sure I cant use this script 2 times too fast or accidentally press any of the keys from 4 to 1 <br><br>

                this mostly solves the problem of making sure I dont get stuck<br>
                I use these scripts in combinations with <a href="telamonsterReload.html">telamonster reload</a>
