            <p>
                you can hold keys using H<br>
                for example:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="code">HWD</div><br>
            <p>
                would hold the keys W and D <br>
                but it would only be held for as long as the script is running or until they are released by R <br>
                to notice the keys being held you should use <a href="../../wait/wait.html">wait</a> <br><br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                you can release keys by using R <br>
                for example: <br>
                <div class="code">HW W1000 RW HD W1000</div><br>
                W is <a href="../../wait/wait.html">wait</a><br>
                would hold W for 1 second then release W then hold D for 1 second! <br><br>
                <b>IF YOU ONLY TYPE R THEN IT RELEASES ALL HELD DOWN KEYS BY THE SCRIPT!</b>
