                you type statements with: () <br><br>

            <h3>KEY LOGIC</h3>
            <p>
                the <a href="../variables/variables.html">inbuilt variable</a> ‡K‡ is very usefull here <br><br>

                key logic is used so that actions only happens if keys are held a certain way <br>
                keys you type out will be true if they are being held <br>
                theres 2 ways to type out keys <br>
                for single letters you can just type them out <br>
                for number keys or other keys you use {}, <a href="../input/specialKeys/special.html">special keys</a><br>
                for example:
            </p>
            <div class="code">W1000 (W) K1</div>
            <p>
                W is <a href="../wait/wait.html">wait</a>, K is <a href="../input/key/key.html">key input</a><br>
                would only press 1 if W is being held <br>
                another example using the <a href="../variables/variables.html">inbuilt variable</a> ‡K‡
            </p>
            <div class="code">W1000 (‡K‡) K1</div>
            <p>
                this script would only press 1 if if the script keybind key is being held <br>
                for example if the keybind is ALT A then 1 would only be pressed if A is being held <br>
                theres another example of ‡K‡ being used in <a href="../variables/variables.html">variables</a> to make an autoclicker<br><br>

                you can specify keys with {}, it is the same keys as <a href="../input/specialKeys/special.html">special keys</a> but you cant do up or down then <br>
                you also use {} to specify numbers keys<br>
                heres an example using number key and space:
            </p>
            <div class="code">WF1000 ({1}) T(you are holding 1!) ({SPACE}) T(you are holding space!)</div>
            <p>
                WF is <a href="../wait/wait.html">wait flag</a>, T is <a href="../input/textInput/text.html">text input</a><br>
                this script would wait 1 second then check if you are holding 1 <br>
                if you are holding 1 it will type out: "you are holding 1!"<br>
                then it will wait 1 second then check if your holding space <br>
                if you are holding space then it will type out: "you are holding space!" <br><br>

                examples using && (AND) and || (OR)<br>
            </p>
            <div class="code">W1000 (Q&&E) K1</div>
            <p>
                this script only only press 1 if Q and E are being held
            </p>
            <div class="code">W1000 (Q||E) K1</div>
            <p>
                this script would only press 1 if Q or E or both are being held <br><br>
                lets say you wanna pause a script if any WASD is being held <br>
                you can do that using || (OR) and ! (NOT):
            </p>
                <div class="code">LF !(W||A||S||D) L C K21 END W100 !(‡K‡) END</div>
            <p>
                LF, L and END is <a href="../loops/loops.html">loop</a>, C is <a href="../input/mouse/mouse.html">click</a> <br>
                using this <a href="#loopNote">fact about loops and statements</a> <br>
                we can make sure that parts of script is only running if a statement is true <br>
                C K21 only happens if W or A or S or D is NOT being held! <br>
                this means NOTHING except wait happens if any WASD is being held <br>
                !(‡K‡) before the last END makes sure that the LF only loops if the script keybind is NOT being held! <br>
                this means for example if the keybind was ALT A then if you were holding A the script would stop!
            </p>

            <h3>VALUES AND <a href="../variables/variables.html">VARIABLES</a> USED IN STATEMENTS</h3>
            <p>
                lets say your having a loop and you want it to press Q when the loop count is 5 <br>
                you get the loop count using the <a href="../variables/variables.html">inbuilt variable</a> ‡I‡ <br>
                for example:
            </p>
            <div class="code">L9 C (‡I‡==5) KQ W25 END</div>
            <p>
                KQ would only happen if the loop count is 5 <br>
                lets say you want KQ to only happen if the loop count is greater than 5 <br>
            </p>
            <div class="code">L9 C (‡I‡&gt;5) KQ W25 END</div>
            <p>
                here KQ would only happen if the loop count is greater than 5 <br>
                if you wanna include 5 then use &gt;= <br>
                you can do the same thing with &lt;=, &lt; <br><br>

                now lets say you want it to only do KQ if it is between 5 and 7 (5 and 7 too)<br>
                you can do it like this:
            </p>
            <div class="code">L9 C (‡I‡&gt;=5&&‡I‡&lt;=7) KQ W25 END</div>
            <p>
                here KQ would only happen if the loops count is 5, 6 and 7 <br><br>
                you can also use your own <a href="../variables/variables.html">custom variables</a> in your statements
            </p>
