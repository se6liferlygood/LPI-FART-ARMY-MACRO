                you can run files by using F and FW <br>
                F runs the file <br>
                FW pauses the macro until the file you ran has closed <br><br>

                the files you run are located in files\macro\custom\ <br><br>

                for example lets say I have a file named helloWorld.bat in the custom folder <br>
                I would run it like this with F: <br>
            </p>
            <div class="code">F(helloWorld.bat)</div>
            <p>
                with FW:
            </p>
            <div class="code">FW(helloWorld.bat)</div>
        </div>
